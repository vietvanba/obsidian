1. Place the tip of your tongue just behind the hard ridge at the front of the top of your mouth
2. Vibrate your vocal cords as this is a voiced sound
3. Start by making a /d/ sound, which is a stop consonant, meaning the airflow is completely stopped at the beginning
4. Transition into the /ʒ/ sound, which is a fricative consonant, meaning you release the air through a narrow constriction that causes turbulence
5. The sound is similar to the /ʃ/ sound in "shoe," but with vocal cord vibration
