## Wildcards
+ Classes in the same package are often imported together. You can use a shortcut to import all the classes in package as an example below:
```java
import java.util.*; // imports java.util.Random among other things

public class ImportExample {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Random r = new Random();
		System.out.println(r.nextInt(10));
	} 
}
```
+ The `*` is a wildcard that matches all classes in the package
+ It doesn't import child packages, fields, or methods. ==ONLY CLASSES==
## Redundant imports
+ Refer to unnecessary import statements in source code.
+ The impact of redundant imports  can include:
	+ Increased source file size
	+ Difficulty in reading and understanding code
	+ Potential for name conflicts
	+ Slow compilation process
## Name conflicts
+ If you import 2 package with using wildcards whose have the same class name in each other as an example below. Java gives you a compiler error. Because the class is found in multiple packages.
```java 
import java.util.*;
import java.sql.*;
```
The compiler error:
```terminal
error: reference to Date is ambiguous

Date date; ^

both class java.sql.Date in java.sql and class java.util.Date in java.util match

In our example, the solution is easy—remove the import java.sql.Date th
```
+ To resolve above error you just need to clarify the class which you need
+ ==Java takes precedence the clarified class over any wildcards present.==
```java
import java.util.Date;
import java.sql.*;
```
### If You really need to Use two Classes with the same name
| Sometimes you really do want to use Date from two different packages. When this happens, you can pick one to use in the import and use the other’s fully qualified class name `[the package name, a period (.), and the class name]` to specify that it’s special. Here’s an example:<br>==import java.util.Date;<br>public class Conflicts { <br>Date date; <br>java.sql.Date sqlDate;<br>}==<br>Or you could have neither with an import and always use the fully qualified class name.public<br>==class Conflicts { <br>java.util.Date date; <br>java.sql.Date sqlDate;}<br>== |

## Creating a new Package
| **Compiling with Wildcards** |
| ---- |
| You can ==use an asterisk== to specify that you’d like to include all Java fi les in a directory. This is convenient when you have a lot of fi les in a package. We can rewrite the previous javac command like this: `javac packagea/*.java packageb/*.java` However, you ==cannot use a wildcard== to **include subdirectories**. If you were to write `javac *.java`, the code in the packages ==would not be picked up==. |
```terminal
java packageb.ClassB
```

## Using an Alternate Directory
![[Pasted image 20240120150035.png]]
+ Three way to run the program 
```termial
java -cp classes packageb.ClassB
java -classpath classes packageb.ClassB 
java --class-path classes packageb.ClassB
```

```
java -cp ".;C:\temp\someOtherLocation;c:\temp\myJar.jar" myPackage.MyClass
```
+ The period (.) indicates you want to include the current directory in the classpath. The rest of the command says to look for loose class files (or packages) in someOtherLocation and within myJar.jar. Windows uses semicolons (;) to separate parts of the classpath; other operating systems use colons.
