+ `var` is a local variable type inference
+ `var` can be refer to primitive or reference type
```java
var number = 10; // infers integer type
var message = "Hello, world!"; // infers string type
```
+ Can't use `var` on variable without initializer
```java
var value; //DOES NOT COMPLIE
var value2 = false; //DOES COMPLIE
```
+ a var ==cannot be initialized with a null value without a type,== it can be ==assigned a null value after it is declared==, provided that the ==underlying data type of the var is an object==.
```java
var n = "myData";
n = null;
var m = 4;
m = null; // DOES NOT COMPILE
```
+ All the types declared on a single line must be the same type and share the same declaration.
```java
public void twoTypes() {
int a, var b = 3; // DOES NOT COMPILE
var n = null; // DOES NOT COMPILE
}
```
+ Can't declared 2 variable with var on the single line
```java
var a = 2, b = 3; // DOES NOT COMPILE
```
+ var wasn't used with constructors, method parameters, or instance variables
```java
public int addition(var a, var b) { // DOES NOT COMPILE
	return a + b; 
}
```
+ var cannot be used to defi ne a type, such as a class, interface, or enum.
```java
public class var { // DOES NOT COMPILE 
	public var() {
	
	} 
}
```
