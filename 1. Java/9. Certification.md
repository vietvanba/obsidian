# JDK 
+ Contains the minimum software you need to do Java development
+ Key pieces include:
	+ javac : the compiler, which converts .java file to .class file
	+ the launcher java: which create the virtual machine and executes the program
+ Other tools:
	+ archiver (jar): which can packages files together
	+ API documentation (javadoc) command to generating documentation 
+ the javac  program generates instructions in a special format that the java command can run called *bytecode*
+ then java launches the JVM before running the code.
+ JRE used for running a program but could not compile one 
+ JRE is no longer available  as a stand-alone download or the directory of the JDK
