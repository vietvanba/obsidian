+ Object Oriented: All code is defined in classes, and most of those classes can be instantiated into objects. Before java was introduced, many languages were procedural, which meant there were routines or methods but no classes
+ Encapsulation: Java supports access modifiers to protect data from unintended access and modification. Most people consider encapsulation to be an aspect of Object oriented languages
+ Platform independent: Java is an interpreted language that gets compiled to bytecode. A key benefit is that java code get compiled once rather than needing to be recompiled for different operating systems. (Write once, run every where)
+ Robust (Mạnh mẽ) One of major advantages of Java over C++ is that it prevents memory leaks. Java manage memory on its own and does garbage collection automatically. Bad ma
+ Simple: Java was intended to be simpler than C++. In addition to eliminating pointers, it got rid of [operator overloading](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operator-overloading-cpp/). 
+ Secure: Java code runs inside the JVM. This creates a sandbox that makes it hard for java code to do evil things to the computer it is running on
