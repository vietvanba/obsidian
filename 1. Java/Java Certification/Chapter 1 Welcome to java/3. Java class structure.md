+ Classes are the basic building blocks
	+ When defining a class you need ==describe all the parts== and ==characteristic== (a typical feature or quality that something/somebody has) of one of those building blocks
+ An object is a ==runtime instance== of class in memory. An object is often referred to as an *==instance==* since it represents a single representation of the class
+ A reference is a variable that point to an object 
## Fields and Methods
- These are called ==the members== of class
+ Methods
	+ often called **functions** or **procedures** in other languages.
	+ operate on field's state
+ Fields
	+ more generally known as **variables**.
	+ hold the state of the program
+ ==**Method signature**== included:
	+ Method name
	+ Parameter list
	+ Return type
	> The method signature serves as a means to distinguish and identify different methods within a single class
+ Method declaration in programming is the process of specifying information about a method that you implement in your program
```java
<access modifier> <return type> <method name>(<parameter list>) 
{ // method body }
```
## Comments
+ There are three types of comments in Java.
	+ single-line
		+ Start with "//"
	+ multi-line
		+ Start with `/*`
		+ End with `*/`
		+ People often type an asterisk (`*`) at the beginning of each line to make it easier to read
	+ Documentation Comments (javadoc)
		+ Start with `/**`
		+ End with `*/`
		+ They are used for generating documentation automatically using tools like javadoc
		+ Javadoc comments provide information about classes, methods, and fields
## Classes vs. Files
+ Each file can contain ==**only one public class**== 
+ The filename must match the class name, including case, and have a *.java* extension.
## main() method
+ Example for main method:
```java
public class Zoo {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        System.out.println("Zoo runed");

    }

}
```
+ How to run above code with terminal:
```terminal
javac Zoo.java //The process to compile Zoo.java
java Zoo // Run code
```
+ What is `String[] args` ?:
	+ This is the parameter list that is passed to the main method from the terminal.
```Java
public class Zoo {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        System.out.println(args[0]);

        System.out.println(args[1]);

    }

}
```

``` terminal
	  java Zoo parameter1 parameter2
```
- The result shown when executing the program is
``` terminal
parameter1
parameter2
```
- If you want the spaces inside an argument, you need to use quotes `"`
	Example:
```terminal
javac Zoo.java
java Zoo "San Diego" Zoo
```
## Running a Program in One Line
+ From java 11, you can run a program without compiling it first (single-file source-code). By skip typing javac command. Just only run java command as an example below
+ This feature usually using at a small or personal project. 
+ If the program has 2 .java file or more, it still need javac command to compile first
```terminal
java Zoo.java Zoo1 Zoo2
```
