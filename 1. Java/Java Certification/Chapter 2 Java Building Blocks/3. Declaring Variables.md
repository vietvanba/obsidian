# Identifying Identifiers
+ Identifiers must begin with a letter, a $ symbol, or a _ symbol.
+ Identifiers can include numbers but not start with them
+ Since Java 9, a single underscore _ is not allowed as an identifier.
+ You cannot use the same name as a Java reserved word. A reserved word is special word that Java has held aside so that you are not allowed to use it. Remember that Java is case sensitive, so you can use versions of the keywords that only differ in case. Please donâ€™t, though
